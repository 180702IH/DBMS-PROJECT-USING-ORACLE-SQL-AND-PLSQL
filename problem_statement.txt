We assume a Property Rental Agency (PRA) scenario where the PRA facilitates
mediating between Owners of properties and the Tenants, across multiple cities
in India. Both Owners and Tenants are treated as the users of the system. There is
a supper user (only one) who is the DBA. Some users are just Managers. DBA can
add/delete/modify other users. Managers can add/modify/delete a property. Add
details about which property is rented to which tenant etc. Some users can play
both owner and tenant roles. That is, they may give their property for rent and
may seek another property from others for rent. A property can be a residential
property (independent house/flat) or a commercial property (shop or
warehouse). Each property has an ID that is unique. Each property has an
owner. A user has an aadhar, name, age, address(includes door#, Street, city, state, and PIN code), and multiple phone numbers. All users will have login credentials. A
user as an owner can register a property he wants to give for rent. Once a
property is given to a tenant, we capture that information. That means we
capture details like what property is rented to which tenant, rent per month,
start date, end date, yearly hike in rent(in %), agency commission, and other info
as necessary. A property may not have a tenant if it is not rented. We also
maintain the history of renting for a property. Every property is entered into the
system with the details like propertyID, owner, available from which date,
available till what date, rent pm, %ge of annual hike in rent, total area(not null),
plinth area(not null), number of bedrooms (if residential), number of floors, year
of construction (not null), locality, address, other facilities, etc. A user when he
uploads a property becomes the owner. He can upload zero to many properties. A
user when he takes property for rent becomes a tenant. He can be a tenant for
zero to many properties.
